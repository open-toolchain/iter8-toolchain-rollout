template.name: "Progressively rollout a Kubernetes app using iter8"
template.description: "With this toolchain, you can develop, build and rollout an application securely into a Kubernetes cluster managed by the IBM Cloud Container Service. By default, the toolchain uses the reviews app from [bookinfo](), but you can link to your own GitHub repository instead. This toolchain is preconfigured for continuous delivery, [Vulnerability Advisor](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/va?topic=va-va_index), [Code Risk Analyzer](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-cd-configure-cra-repos), source control, issue tracking, and online editing.\n\n You can manage your IBM Cloud Container clusters in the [console](https://cloud.ibm.com/kubernetes/clusters).\n\nThis toolchain uses tools that are part of the Continuous Delivery service. If an instance of that service isn't already in the selected resource group or organization, when you click **Create**, it is automatically added with the free [Lite](/catalog/services/continuous-delivery/) plan selected.\n\nTo get started, click **Create**.\n\nFor step-by-step instructions, follow the [tutorial](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/garage/tutorials/progressive-rollout-kubernetes-iter8-toolchain)."
template.gettingStarted: " **Your toolchain is ready!**\n**Quick start:** Commit a change in master branch to the Git repo to start progressive rollout of new feature in your Kubernetes cluster. For step-by-step instructions, see the [tutorial](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/garage/tutorials/progressive-rollout-kubernetes-iter8-toolchain) for this toolchain."
